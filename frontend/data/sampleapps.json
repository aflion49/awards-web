            "answer": "One of the primary purposes of the Star Wars opening scene is to show the sense of scale difference between the Empire and the Rebels. This is reinforced in two ways: The camera angles and size/amount of the Imperial ship and troops.\r\n\r\nThe scene shows the rebel ship cross into view from the top right corner, small enough that you barely notice it before the entire thing is in view. As it zooms further in, the relation between it and the planet below makes it seem smaller still. Just as the viewer takes in the [ship’s size in relation to the rest of the scene](https://i.imgur.com/Ki4Tzo5.png), the Star Destroyer appears. Initially it crosses in from the same angle, signifying a chase, but the sides of the ships expand to [fill the entire vertical screen after but a few seconds](https://i.imgur.com/ELxJf34.png). In contrast to the Rebel ship, the Star Destroyer *grows* as it enters the frame instead of shrinking. It’s looming, like a giant, yet still fast enough to slowly overtake the Rebel ship. Its framing makes it seem large even compared to the planet below.\r\n\r\nAs the scene continues we see that the Rebel ship’s laser beams bounce off the bulk of the Star Destroyer, while the latter throws out many of its own lasers. Just a single one of these almost seems the size of the Rebel ship which explodes on contact. Hundreds of lasers, each almost the size of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe scale is further emphasized when the Star Destroyer flies over the Rebel ship. We already saw its opening as a small part if it get able to engulf the other ship easily. The shadows as the Destroyer approaches is reminiscent of a large beast’s jaws.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the movie we have yet to see the enemy. The rebels look like humans in uniform, but we have no idea what the Imperial troops are supposed to look like. There is a sense of foreboding and anxiety as the infinite sounds of the Destroyer booms around the rebel ship and then we see the compliment to the lasers in the earlier scene: A myriad of identical-looking stormtroopers *swarm* out of the door like termites or ants. Every single shot shows more and more of them and there’s always a new stormtrooper entering the frame from any side. The sheer amount of troopers entering the ship gives us a sense of the scale of the Empire.\r\n\r\nFinally, Darth Vader appears. His black costume contrasts well with the otherwise uniform white of the space ship and stormtroopers, but the important part is the camera angle. In all of his appearances (https://imgur.com/a/qJ4gUpd) we’re always looking *up* at him. He’s larger, more imposing, at a bigger scale, than the Rebels and our point of view. This constant reinforcement of his size through the camera angle maintains that difference. Contrast this with [Leia bending down towards RT-D2 in a small corridor framed by bulkheads on all sides](blob:https://imgur.com/be4f1c7d-b146-4323-9871-b4a687fe49f4).Small and cornered. And, jumping forward a few minutes, [the final shot of the escaping shuttle, even smaller contrasted against Tatooine](https://i.imgur.com/DiKIjL4.png) giving us the final sense of scale the Rebels are facing.\r\n\r\n**Score:** Qualifies for Main\r\n\r\n**Comment:** Effectively covers the points expressed in the introduction with evidence, describing how each moment relates to their indicated purpose. With the usage of a well-known scene from Star Wars the context is understood that one side is fighting overwhelming odds - suggested also in the app here - though the app is relying on an implicit understanding of the conflict between Rebels and the Empire of why the scale is significant. It also doesn't mention which Star Wars film they're talking about. \r\n\r\nTo further improve the writeup, I would like to see expressly why the applicant thinks the scale is a point of emphasis in this scene. (since we will not always have context on submitted scenes)"

            "answer": "The opening scene of Star Wars: A New Hope is a masterclass in setting the stakes and tone for the movie in the first five minutes through its audio-visual presentation. \r\n\r\nImmediately following the opening text crawl, we are thrown into space, where a small and round rebel spaceship is being followed by a gargantuan star destroyer. The design of these instantly says a lot about our opposing forces - the plucky design of the rebel ship looks very friendly, and the shape is dominated by engines - showing how the rebels have to make use of whatever scant resources are available. Meanwhile the imposing design of the imperial destroyer, with its massive armor gives a clear idea of the extravagance and might of the Galactic Empire. The practical miniatures also look much better than the cgi mess used in further films, which gives the original trilogy that timeless look, rather than making them look dated in 5 years, unlike many of the laser beams.\r\n\r\nAboard the ship we get more visual symbolism that tells us what the fight between the rebels and the empire is like - the rebel fighters have no armor and only laser pistols, and we see the human faces of all the fallen. But the imperial stormtroopers are decked out in pristine armor suits, have more powerful and sophisticated rifles that can have a stun setting (a neat callback to any star trek fans), but they are masked by their helmets and all identical - a clear sign of their expendability. An interesting contrast arises from the imperial color design - while the soldiers everyone sees are clad in white, a color of peace, their evil leader is in full black armor, which ties in with the dark side he commands. Incidentally, Princess Leia is also draped in a full-white dress.  \r\n\r\nIf the visuals are what set the stakes and introduce the world, the soundtrack is what establishes the tone of this franchise. The music masterfully creates a feeling of dread, as if the Empire has almost won. As the camera switches to inside the ship, foreboding music comes in - signaling the anxious and uncertain state of the rebels preparing to be boarded. Over the course of the battle the military march of the empire takes over more and more. But, even in their victory, the soundtrack introduces a faint, but hopeful flute as Princess Leia stores away the stolen plans with R2D2 - which ties them with the movie’s theme of resistance in the face of overwhelming adversity. \r\n\r\n**Score:** Qualifies for Open\r\n\r\n**Comment:** The overall analysis here is good, however the writeup has a few flaws. Points can be more specific, for example by using shape language to explain why the Rebel ship’s design appears plucky, while the Imperial Destroyer’s design feels imposing. Similarly, the points about the music being foreboding or inducing dread could be expanded.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the color symbolism of the Imperial outfit is contradictory (do we know that white symbolizes peace in this world when it’s worn by an occupying force?).\r\n\r\nThe writeup also includes a few tangential remarks, such as those about the CGI in modern movies and Princess Leia’s dress, that don’t fit the argument being made. The mention of Leia’s dress could have been made more relevant by tying it to her upbringing in contrast to the rest of the Rebel Alliance."

            "answer": "The Star Wars opening is iconic. The purpose is to introduce the viewer to the universe and it does so by first introducing us to the rebels with C3PO and R2D2 and then the Empire with the Star Destroyer and Darth Vader. It clearly shows who’s the good guys and who’s the bad guys using music and colors. When we see Darth Vader he’s imposing and scary. Meanwhile Leia is feeding the plans to R2D2 which means they’re hiding something. Later we see him go into the pod to escape to Tatooine with the plans. Darth Vader force chokes some people to get information but doesn’t get what he’s seeking. Along the way, the Rebel army gets shot by the stormtroopers. These scenes introduce us to the Star Wars world and gives us an introduction to it. We also see some great banter between 3CPO and R2D2 and it gives us further insight into the characters. It also shows us that alongside the Empire there’s still a senate and a princess.\r\n\r\nThe intro also has some cool action shots and great soundtrack which makes the entire thing feel more epic. Since the movie is set in space it makes sense to be majestic and have large space ships. Overall this scene is super good and does its job very well at making us care about the Rebels.\r\n\r\n**Score:** Doesn't Qualify\r\n\r\n**Comment:** Doesn't answer the question in analyzing the elements in one scene. Mentions how the purpose is shown, but provides no further analysis on the elements described. Provides a fair number of events in the scene described, but fails to link them to the purpose or elements for analysis."

The short depicts sensations like hearing, touch, and smell filling in the blanks of the blind girl's vision with small cues such as a fur ball turning into a cat when she hears it meow.

The repetitive and cloying soundtrack made everything else exponentially worse too.\r\n\r\nPost your own analysis of the short, making sure to respond to both jurors by expanding the points you agree with and tackling the ones you disagree with. Feel free to bring up points not mentioned in either writeup in support of your position.",
            "answer": "There are some conceptually neat ideas here, but I wholeheartedly agree with the second juror about it losing what was initially exciting about the work for a more familiar and trite adventure as it progresses. \r\n\r\nAs the protagonist first enters the darkened alley, a world shrouded in darkness opens up to 'light' as she compensates with her other senses, depicting a worldview that is fundamentally different from society at large. The most striking depiction of this is her touching the metal railings with her wooden stick. The spiraling pattern that bursts forth in color after this act perfectly mirrors the resonance of the metallic sound, and its quick subsidence provides great insight into the discrete stimuli perceived by the protagonist. This feeling is further strengthened by the camera dollying back to a wide shot, conveying both the alley's vastness and the girl's position within it.\r\n\r\nThe short loses its potency as it moves outside the alley, opting for increasingly tokenizing symbols of childish whimsy. The exceptions are the cat example brought up by the first juror and the scene with the lady who has a flower for a head as a marker for her perfume, both of which I found charming. However, the cliched elements, such as her cane turning into a wand and her dress becoming a witch's garb, as mentioned by the second juror, diminish the narrative. The entire world is bathed in harsh, even lighting, a far cry from the dim but clear-eyed atmosphere that characterized her worldview just moments ago. Everything becomes more artificial as the world shifts into a rotating diorama. The flying whale scene is particularly egregious; it leaves the girl behind to showcase a fancy whimsical figure hanging over the entire world, symbolizing the deprioritization of her perspective as the short focuses on a safe, family-friendly adventure. \r\n\r\nThe overall aesthetic beyond the alleys is fairly tepid as well, with the world outside depicted in dull pastels that, combined with the even lighting, make the work appear flat. The short’s animation is thorough but not particularly standout; I expected more character in the movement. Her muted reactions to the disturbances at 3:51 and 4:03 are disappointingly lacking. \r\n\r\nI lean toward the second juror regarding the soundtrack. While it does a decent job of evoking feelings of urgency (0:26) or trepidation (0:56) that the girl seems to experience in the alley, it’s not a terribly complex soundtrack. It mostly consists of piano at the beginning and end, sometimes disappearing entirely when there's nothing to accompany. During the main street segment, it moves away from describing the scene and instead repeats the same short phrase over and over. The introduction of new instruments feels phoned in to me, reminding me of greeting card jingles—everything is pleasant and quaint, but also likely outsourced as cheaply as possible, to the point of wearing on the listener. Combined with the loud cityscape's incessant construction and car noise, the end result is a cacophony that is deeply unpleasant and detracts from the short's enjoyability. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think the short thoroughly misses the mark after an excellent beginning that suggested a far better work than what we received. \r\n\r\n**Score:** Qualifies for Main\r\n\r\n**Comment:** Effectively addresses points by both jurors by giving proper examples. Also brings in valid new points not mentioned by either juror in support of their position."

            "answer": "\"Out of Sight\" effectively conveys the experience of its blind protagonist by creatively emphasizing her senses of touch, smell, and hearing. The short highlights her reliance on touch early on, showing her bumping into a fence and carefully tracing its edges. Her cautious body language—slowly inching forward and feeling the ground beneath her feet until startled by the stick’s sensation—demonstrates how she maps her surroundings through tactile feedback. Smell is thoughtfully integrated when she follows the aroma of freshly baked bread or perceives a lady’s perfume visualized as a blooming flower. Likewise, sound cues guide her journey; the changing rhythm and beat of her stick as it interacts with different surfaces indicate shifts in terrain. The soundtrack enhances these cues, starting with a serene piano melody, becoming tense as she navigates the unfamiliar alley, then turning lively during her more adventurous city tour, before returning to a calm theme as she reunites with Coco. In this way each sense is presented with a distinct visual and auditory language, making her invisible world vivid for viewers.\r\n\r\nMagical elements, like her stick transforming into a wand, serve as visual metaphors for how she reimagines her surroundings. Whimsical touches, such as flying whales and fishy cars, emphasize the childlike wonder with which she explores her environment—much like her playful interactions with railings as if they were a vibraphone or her joy when a cat stops by to play. Rather than depicting her blindness as a limitation, the short uses these imaginative scenes to highlight her unique perception. \r\n\r\n**Score:** Qualifies for Main\r\n\r\n**Comment:** Doesn't directly point out any juror opinions but still addresses all points raised in the opinions succinctly including supporting the short's depiction of her senses, the soundtrack's role in enhancing the work, and arguing against why the fantasy elements aren't a mismatch for the work. This writeup could be further improved by raising analysis points not mentioned in either opinion to strengthen the author's position."

            "answer": "I agree with the first juror’s point about the short’s ability to convey its narrative without relying on dialogue. We’re shown early on that the girl is blind—when she bumps into the fence, the way she traces its contours makes it clear that she’s using her sense of touch to perceive what we can already see. This revelation is crucial before her adventure truly begins, as it allows us to immerse ourselves in her journey rather than trying to grasp the short’s central premise. While we can’t physically feel the objects displayed, and we witness things she cannot see, understanding her blindness helps us interpret how she experiences the world around her. This lets us focus on the sensory cues provided and experience her journey in tandem with her perspective.\r\n\r\nThe animation plays a major role in conveying the sensory cues highlighted by the first juror, particularly in terms of their tactile qualities. For example, when she feels along the fence, the fluttering of her dress points out the hole in it. The way the wind ruffles her dress realistically, moving in a gentle arc from front to back in the direction of the hole, helps us imagine what that sensation might feel like as a guiding sign for the girl, even though we can already see it. Additionally, as she explores the jagged gap, her hands move in ways that emphasize the different angles and directions she encounters while tracing various surfaces of the fence. This is especially apparent when she maneuvers her hand around a jagged protrusion near the top of the hole, indicating that she’s sensing an opening rather than a continuous surface. Her movements are fluid, yet they have a practiced quality, consistent with someone who is used to navigating without sight.\r\n\r\nThe magical elements seem to depict the whimsy of a child’s mind, so they don’t hamper my enjoyment of the short. \r\n\r\n**Score:** Qualifies for Open\r\n\r\n**Comment:** It doesn't address the soundtrack point raised by either juror and it just dismisses the fantasy point the second juror raised without any introspection or provision counterexamples. The writeup also focuses too much on summarizing one small scene, instead of providing a holistic analysis"

            "answer": "I understand the concept behind the short’s depiction of the senses; however, I believe it’s marred by small inconsistencies that undermine the verisimilitude of the work for me. For instance, when she runs her hands along the wooden fence, the sound produced is uniformly smooth, which doesn’t match the rougher texture of the gap she’s tracing. Moments later, when she squeezes through the gap, the sound accurately conveys the tightness of the space, with noises of her rubbing against both the ground and the edges of the opening. Visually, however, her hat slips through the jagged top too cleanly, without any kind of snagging. This misalignment between what the visuals depict and what the soundscape indicates should never occur in a work that ostensibly aims to represent hearing, among other senses, as integral to the makeup of the detailed umwelt of a blind person. Every other issue presented by the jurors above is secondary to this. \r\n\r\n**Score:** Qualifies for Open\r\n\r\n**Comment:** A short writeup which still makes a detailed case tackling Juror 1's point.
